# teaching-ecg-towel
Simulates a teaching experiment/demonstration related to electrocardiography. The experiment is used to teach medecine and pharmacy students the biophysical fundamentals of ecg recordings. The experiment involves a wet towel, representing the human tissue and body. ECG electrodes are used to measure the electrical potential created by a small power source (representing the heart) under different angles (leads).
